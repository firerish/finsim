Parameters in these sections will have an intuitive format, for example positive whole integers for numbers like values and years, alphanumeric strings for names, drop-down boxes for options. The only negative number allowed is the one that specifies the market drop for the market crash event speficied below.\n\nThe first input section allows the user to enter their current financial situation, which includes current savings, money currently in their retirement account, current investments, current age, target retirement age, target final age, and target cash savings.\n\nThe second input section allows the user to specify how much of their disposable income they want to invest in different investment types (pension, equity, ETFs, or investment trusts), and in what order to drawdawn from these investments when the need arises to cover expenses. The order will be specified by assigning a number to each item, 1 being the first choice to drawdown from, 2 being the second choice once the first one is depleted, etc. Each one has to be a different order number, and they have to be consecutive, starting at 1. You can use a drop-down for that.\n\nThe third input section ellows the user to add life events that have a start year and an end year. Life events can overlap in time, start or end at the same year. They are independent of each other, except for the real estate and he mortgage events specified below.\n\nLife events also have an optional value and a yearly rate of growth (when not specified, the inflation rate is used). \n\nA life event can be a job (specifying the salary, shares, bonus, pension company match), a rent income, a non-taxable income, a real estate event (ownership of a property), a mortgage event (specifying yearly repayment and the loan rate, and should have the same name as a real estate event and match the start year of that event), an expense event, or a stock market event (like a crash). All events have a name that the user can specify. A real estate event can have one corresponding (by name) mortgage event, but a mortgage event must have a corresponding real estate event.\n\nThe fourth input section allows the user to specify economic parameters like rate of inflation, expected yearly growth of different asset types (stock, pension, etc), optionally specifying a variance for these values (standard deviation). All these values should be positive percentages.\n\nAfter completing all the four previous input sections, which constitute the parameters for the simmulation, the user can run the simulation by clicking a button \"run simulation\". All the data provided by the user will be sent to the backend in a json format.\n\nThe simulation will be run in the node.js backend. The code to run the simulation already exists and doesn't need to be provided by you. Only provide the scaffolding around it to get the parameters provided by the user through the React frontend and to provide the data (in json format) required for the frontend to show the results.\n\nOnce the simulation finishes, the frontend presents three output sections.\n\nThe first output section will be an assessment of the user-provided scenario. If the user provided variances for the enonomic parameters, the result will be a percentage representing the likelyhood of success of the scenario (for example \"Likelihood of success: 90%\"). If the user didn't provide variances, the simulation shows \"Success\" if the simulation finished with money left at the target final date, or \"Failure\" otherwise.\n\nThe second output section will be a stacked line graph of the assets year by year (starting at the current age and ending at the target final date), showing the accumulated net worth in terms of cash, real estate, and each investment type.\n\nThe third output section will be a stacked line graph of the cash flow year by year (like the previous one), showing the different sources of income and expenses.\n\nThe user will then be able to go back to the input sections, edit the information, and run the simulation again.\n\nUse any libraries or frameworks for this project as long as they are open source.\n\nThe whole frontend should feel modern, easy to use, intuitive, and have a free flow between the sections, so the user can go back and forth and play around with the scenarios and see the result of each change. Errors from the backend will be part of the json response and should be shown to the user in an unobstrusive way, for example in a separate \"Errors and warnings\" section that the user can check at any time.\n\nThe user will be able to save the scenario with a name, and load scenarios by name (present a list of saved scenarios to select from). The user will also be able to export the scenarios with the results in pdf format. The user will also be able to reset the scenario and remove all events, but they need to confirm that they agree to lose all the information, in case they haven't saved it.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Areas that need clarification:\n1.
